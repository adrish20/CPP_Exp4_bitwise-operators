<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>C++ bitwise operators manipulate individual bits of integral data types. They include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). These operators are used for tasks like setting, clearing, and toggling bits, and are essential in low-level programming and performance optimization.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this experiment helped us understand about bitwise operators. We perfromed bit set and reset using bitwise operators.</p>
